Data Science Midterm
================

The raw data used in this analysis consists of Change of Address (COA)
data from the US Postal Service for New York City between 2018 and 2022.
The COA data includes information on the total number of permanent
address changes going into and out of each ZIP code in New York City.
The initial section of the report focuses on importing, cleaning, and
ensuring data quality. This process results in a clean and structured
dataset, ready for analysis. The datasetâ€™s characteristics, including
observations, unique ZIP codes, and neighborhoods, are described. Data
quality issues are also addressed. The subsequent section visualizes the
data with an analysis of address change trends, uncovering extreme
values, and plots that highlight neighborhood-level insights over the
five-year period. The report concludes with an acknowledgment of any
limitations of the dataset.
