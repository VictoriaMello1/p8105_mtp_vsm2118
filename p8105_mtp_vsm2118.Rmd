This analysis uses 2018-2022 Change of Address (COA) data from the USPS for New York City. The COA data includes information on the total number of permanent address changes going into and out of each zipcode in NYC. This report encompasses the data import, cleaning, and visualization process to examine the net address change trends by borough over the five years. Dataset limitations for analyzing population changes are also addressed.

## Section 1 â€“ Data import, cleaning, and quality control

```{r}
zip_data = read_csv("zip_codes.csv")

sheet_names <- c("2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022")
coa_data <- map_dfr(sheet_names, ~ readxl::read_xlsx("USPS.xlsx", sheet = .x))

view(coa_data)

coa_data = coa_data %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(str_sub(month, 1, 4)),
    net_change = `total_perm_in` - `total_perm_out`
  )
```

```{r}
# Create a "borough" variable in the ZIP code data
zip_data <- zip_data %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(zipcode = zip_code) %>% 
  mutate(
    borough = case_when(
      county_name %in% c("Kings") ~ "Brooklyn",
      county_name %in% c("Queens") ~ "Queens",
      county_name == "Bronx" ~ "Bronx",
      county_name == "New York" ~ "Manhattan",
      county_name == "Richmond" ~ "Staten Island"
    )
  )
  view(zip_data)

```

```{r}
# Merge the COA and ZIP code data based on ZIP code
merged_data <- coa_data %>%
  left_join(zip_data, by = "zipcode")

# Select only the necessary variables for later visualizations
final_data <- merged_data %>%
    mutate(
    borough = case_when(
      county_name == "Kings" ~ "Brooklyn",
      county_name == "Queens" ~ "Queens",
      county_name == "Bronx" ~ "Bronx",
      county_name == "New York" ~ "Manhattan",
      county_name == "Richmond" ~ "Staten Island"
    ),
    month = month(month, label = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  select(zipcode, neighborhood, borough, year, month, net_change, city)

# Cleaning zipcodes incorrectly classified for borough
final_data <- final_data %>%
  mutate(borough = case_when(
    zipcode == 10463 ~ "Bronx",
    zipcode == 11201 ~ "Brooklyn",
    zipcode == 11239  ~ "Brooklyn",
    zipcode == 11693 ~ "Queens",
    TRUE ~ borough
  ))  %>% 
  distinct()

view(final_data)
```

Major steps in data wrangling involved importing, cleaning, and merging datasets. This process included transforming the Change of Address (COA) data, creating a "borough" variable for zipcode data, merging the datasets by zipcode, and selecting key variables. Data quality issues were addressed by reclassifying zipcodes incorrectly classified for borough and deleting duplicate observations. The resulting tidy dataset contains a total of `r nrow(final_data)` observations. It includes data from `r n_distinct(final_data$zipcode)` zipcodes and data from `r n_distinct(final_data$neighborhood)` neighborhoods. 

```{r}
# Filter the data for Manhattan and Queens
manhattan_data <- final_data %>%
  filter(borough == "Manhattan")

queens_data <- final_data %>%
  filter(borough == "Queens")

# Create tables for the most common cities in Manhattan and Queens
manhattan_table <- manhattan_data %>%
  count(city, sort = TRUE)

queens_table <- queens_data %>%
  count(city, sort = TRUE)

knitr::kable(manhattan_table, caption = "Manhattan most common city value")
knitr::kable(queens_table, caption = "Queens most common city value")
```

#### Data Quality Issues 
In the Manhattan table, variations in city names like "NEW YORK" and "NYC" can lead to inaccurate analysis and visualization, potentially duplicating and/or misrepresenting zipcode data. There are also duplicate city's and spelling errors among values in city variable. The city variable has various data quality issues and should not be used in further analysis. 


```{r}
zip_code_counts <- final_data %>%
  group_by(zipcode, neighborhood, borough, city) %>%
  summarise(Observation_Count = n())

zip_count_60 <- zip_code_counts %>%
  filter(Observation_Count < 60) %>%
  arrange(desc(Observation_Count))
```

There are `r nrow(zip_count_60)` zipcodes with fewer than 60 observations for change of address. There are various potential factors that are likely contributing to these specific zipcodes having less observations. For example, many of these zipcodes are within the midtown and lower Manhattan neighborhoods, which are characterized by large business/commercial areas. Zipcodes in these business-centric areas may be predominantly associated with commercial addresses and PO boxes, resulting in fewer residential address changes and contributing to missing neighborhood values. Additionally, many of these zipcodes are within residential neighborhoods of Queens and Brooklyn where property ownership is more likely, thus these zipcodes may have fewer COAs.
 

## Section 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

```{r}
# Group by borough and year, and calculate the average net_change
average_net_change_table <- final_data %>%
  group_by(borough, year) %>%
  summarize(Average_Net_Change = mean(net_change, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(borough, year)

average_net_change_table <- average_net_change_table %>%
  rename(`Borough` = borough, `Year` = year, `Average Net Change` = Average_Net_Change)

knitr::kable(average_net_change_table, caption = "Table displaying average net address changes per borough and year, excluding missing values") 
```

Notable trends for this table include a sharp decline in net change values for all boroughs in 2020, except for Staten Island, where a decline occurred in 2021. In 2020, Manhattan had the most significant decline, followed by Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens. However, Manhattan also displayed the most robust recovery in 2021. 

```{r}
lowest_net_change <- final_data %>%
  arrange(net_change) %>%
  head(5) %>%
  select(zipcode, neighborhood, year, month, net_change)

knitr::kable(lowest_net_change, caption = "Lowest Net Change in COA Requests")
```

```{r}
highest_net_change_pre_2020 <- final_data %>%
  filter(year < 2020) %>%
  arrange(desc(net_change)) %>%
  head(5) %>%
  select(zipcode, neighborhood, year, month, net_change)

knitr::kable(highest_net_change_pre_2020, caption = "Highest Net Change in COA Requests Pre-2020")
```

#### Visualization:

queens_data <- final_data %>% filter(borough == "Queens")
staten_island_data <- final_data %>% filter(borough == "Staten Island")


# Step 2: Calculate the average net_change values across ZIP codes within neighborhoods for each month and year
manhattan_avg_net_change <- manhattan_data %>%
  group_by(year, month, neighborhood) %>%
  summarize(avg_net_change = mean(net_change)) %>%
  ungroup()

brooklyn_avg_net_change <- brooklyn_data %>%

# Step 3: Create separate plots for each borough

  labs(title = "Staten Island", x = "Month", y = "Average Net Change") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

# Step 4: Combine the plots using patchwork
library(patchwork)
all_boroughs_plot <- manhattan_plot / brooklyn_plot / bronx_plot / queens_plot / staten_island_plot

all_boroughs_plot <- all_boroughs_plot +
  plot_annotation(title = "Neighborhood-Level Average Net Change by Borough, 2018-2022")

```
![Neighborhood-Level Average Net Change by Borough, 2018-2022](results/all_boroughs_plot.png)

In 2020, all NYC boroughs except Staten Island experienced a decline in average net change in COAs from April to July, likely due to the onset of COVID-19. Although the neighborhoods in these boroughs did slowly recover after July 2020 and remained relatively stable. The Bronx had a milder COVID-related dip and a significant spike in average net change in COAs for the Central Bronx and High Bridge/Morrisania neighborhoods during November, 2021. Queens also had a less severe COVID-related decline, with the exception of western neighborhoods bordering Manhattan. 

This dataset is limited in providing a comprehensive understanding of zipcode-level population changes because it does not account for variations in the number of individuals residing at each address which would be necessary for population change estimates.
