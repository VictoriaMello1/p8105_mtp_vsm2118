!!!!\*\*\*\*CHECK WORD COUNT FOR STRICT 500 WORD LIMIT\*\*\*\*\*\*!!!!!!

(134 words) The raw data used in this analysis consists of Change of
Address (COA) data from the US Postal Service for New York City between
2018 and 2022. The COA data includes information on the total number of
permanent address changes going into and out of each ZIP code in New
York City. The initial section of the report focuses on importing,
cleaning, and ensuring data quality. This process results in a clean and
structured dataset, ready for analysis. The dataset’s characteristics,
including observations, unique ZIP codes, and neighborhoods, are
described. Data quality issues are also addressed. The subsequent
section visualizes the data with an analysis of address change trends,
uncovering extreme values, and plots that highlight neighborhood-level
insights over the five-year period. The report concludes with an
acknowledgment of any limitations of the dataset.

  ) %>%

(28 words) The resulting tidy dataset final_data contains a total of
12085 observations. It includes data from 237 unique ZIP codes and data
from 43 unique neighborhoods.

Queens most common city value

#### Data Quality Issues

(108 words) In the Manhattan table, there appears to be variations in
city names such as “NEW YORK,” “NYC,” and “WALL STREET.” These
variations may hinder accurate analysis and visualization by potentially
duplicating or misrepresenting data. Additionally, the presence of
“BRONX” and “BROOKLYN” entries within Manhattan suggests data entry
errors or misclassification, which could lead to inaccuracies in
borough-specific analyses. Based on these observations it seems that the
“city” variable is not currently usable as it has both borough and
neighborhood information. Instead, for analysis we can use the
“neighborhood” variable for more micro-neighborhood level analysis as
well as the “borough” variable that was created in the data cleaning
step.

``` r
# Count the observations for each ZIP code
zip_code_counts <- final_data %>%
  group_by(zipcode, neighborhood, borough, city) %>%
  summarise(Observation_Count = n())
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'zipcode', 'neighborhood', 'borough'. You
    ## can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
# Filter for ZIP codes with less than 60 observations
zip_count_60 <- zip_code_counts %>%
  filter(Observation_Count < 60) %>%
  arrange(desc(Observation_Count))

knitr::kable(zip_count_60)
```

(204 words) As shown in the table above there are 193 zip codes with
fewer than 60 observations for change of address. There are a few
potential reasons and factors that are likely resulting in these
specific zip codes having so few observations. For example many of the
zip codes in this tabel that are located in Manhattan are within the
lower and midtown neighborhoods, which are areas characterized by
numerous business districts and commercial areas. Thus these zip codes
may be predominantly associated with business addresses, resulting in a
lower frequency of residential address changes. Another observation from
this table that could explain a potential reason for these zip codes
having less than 60 observations for changes in address is that many of
these zip codes are within residential areas where people are more
likely to own property and as a result might not be moving in and out of
the neighborhood as frequently. In the table there is a high
representation of zip codes from Queens and Brooklyn which are boroughs
with higher rates of home ownership, pointing to this being a potential
factor at play.
